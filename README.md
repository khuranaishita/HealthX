# HealthX
Patients always find it difficult to book an appointment by calling in a hospital/clinic. Sometimes it very time consuming and frustrating as staff members do not about doctors availability when patients call in, this creates a problem for both patient and doctors. In our project, we have build website (HealthX), where the patient can create their account, view availability of doctors and book their appointment accordingly. Once the appointment is booked patient can view it in Appointment screen and if they want to cancel it they can cancel it from this screen. This website makes it easier for the patient to check doctors availability before booking an appointment as it shows their availability on the homepage. Also, patients receive notification via email when appointment gets a book or cancel.
